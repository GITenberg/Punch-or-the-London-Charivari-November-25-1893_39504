<h2>THE HEIGHT OF COMFORT.</h2>
<ul class="none">
<li><i>Q.</i> I want to consult you about Flats. You must know all about
them, as you have tried this kind of "high life" for a year. And
I am quite charmed with the idea of getting one. Now, don't you
find that they have many advantages over the old-fashioned separate
house system?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Oh, a great many!</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> I suppose that even in such paradises a few drawbacks do exist?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> A few. For instance, did you notice, during your painful
progress upstairs, a doctor coming out of the rooms just below us?
No? Then you were fortunate. There's a typhoid case there, we
hear.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Dear me! Now I think of it, I did meet a woman dressed as
a hospital nurse. But she was coming down from somewhere
above you.</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Yes. The people over our heads. It's a scarlet fever patient
they have, I believe. We can hear the nurse moving about in the
middle of the night. And chemists' boys with medicines call at our
door, by mistake, at all hours.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Still, they can't get in. Your flat is your castle, surely?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Quite so. It's a pity it isn't a roomier castle. Our bedrooms
are like cupboards, and look out on a dark court. We have to keep
the gas burning there all day.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Oh, indeed! But then, being on one floor, living must be
much cheaper, because you can do with only one servant?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That is true; but we find that the difficulty is to get servants
to do with us. They hate being mastheaded like this; they miss
the area, and the talks with the tradesmen, and so on.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But they must go downstairs to take dust and cinders away?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No, those go down the shoot. At least, a good many of the
cinders do, though some seem to stop on the way. Our downstair
neighbours complain horribly, and threaten to summon us.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Do they? On the whole, however, you find your fellow-residents
obliging?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Oh, very! The landing window leads to some disputes. We
like it open. The people upstairs prefer it shut. The case comes on
at the police court next week.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> You surprise me! Then, as regards other expenses, you save,
don't you, by paying no rates?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> We do. That is why our landlord charges us for these eight
rooms on one floor just double what we should have to pay for a
large house all to ourselves.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Thanks for giving me so much information. Of course, I
knew there must be some disadvantages. And you won't be surprised
to hear that we have taken a flat after all, as they are so
fashionable?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> On the contrary, I should be quite surprised if you didn't.</li>

<h4>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Scene XV.</span>&mdash;<i>The Drawing-room at Hornbeam Lodge.</i>
<span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Monday
evening, about six.</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>is listlessly striking chords
on the piano</i>; Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>is sitting by one of the windows</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Where <i>did</i> <span class="sc">Theophilus</span> go
last Saturday?
He is either the most consummate hypocrite, or the most
blameless lamb that ever breathed; and I'm sure <i>I</i> don't know
which! But I'll find out when <span class="sc">Charles</span> comes. It would be
almost a relief to find Pa <i>was</i> guilty; for, if he isn't&mdash;&mdash; But, thank
goodness, he is not very likely ever to hear where <i>I</i> was that
evening!</p>

<p><i>Althea</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It couldn't <i>really</i> have been Mamma in
that
box; she has never made the slightest reference to it. I almost
wish she <i>had</i> been there; it would have been easier to tell her.
What <i>would</i> she say if she knew I had gone to such a place
as the Eldorado?</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>She drifts, half unconsciously, into the air of</i> "The Hansom Cabman."</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> What is that tune you are playing, <span class="sc">Thea</span>?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>flushing</i>). N&mdash;nothing, Mamma. Only a
tune I heard when I was in town. The&mdash;the boys
in the street whistle it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Then it's hardly fit to be played
upon <i>my</i> piano. I shouldn't wonder if it came out
of one of those abominable music-halls!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). She must mean something by
that. If she was there after all! (<i>Aloud, distressed.</i>)
Mamma, what makes you say that?
Do&mdash;do you <i>know</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>in equal confusion</i>). Know! Explain
yourself, child. How could I possibly&mdash;&mdash;?
(<i>To herself.</i>) I shall betray myself if I am not
more careful!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> I&mdash;I thought&mdash;I don't know&mdash;it was the
way you said it. (<i>To herself.</i>) I very nearly did
for myself <i>that</i> time!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>as</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>strikes more chords</i>).
For goodness' sake, <span class="sc">Thea</span>, either play a proper
piece, or shut up the piano and take up some
useful work. There's the crazy-quilt I've begun
for the Bazaar; you might get on with that.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>closing the piano</i>). The colours <i>are</i> so
frightful, Mamma!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> What does that signify, my dear?
When it's for a charity! Really, I'm beginning
to think this visit to town has not had at all a
good effect upon you. You've come back unable
to settle down to anything. Yes, I see a great
change in you, <span class="sc">Althea</span>, and it's not confined to
the worldly way you do your hair. I sincerely
hope it will not strike Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> as it does
me. You know he is dining here this evening?
I told him in my note that if he <i>liked</i> to come a
little earlier&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Significantly.</i>) I think he has
something to say to you, <span class="sc">Thea</span>. Perhaps you can
guess what?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>twisting her hands nervously</i>). Oh no,
Mamma. I&mdash;I can't see Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>&mdash;not alone,
I mean.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Don't be ridiculous, my dear. You
know perfectly well that he admires you. He has very properly
spoken first to your father, and we both consider you a most fortunate
girl. He is a truly excellent young man, which is the <i>first</i>
consideration; and, what is even <i>more</i> important, he is, as far as I
can gather, making an excellent income. And you can't deny that
you were interested in him from the very first.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> N&mdash;not in that way, Mamma. At least, not any longer.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Nonsense. If Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> proposes, I shall be
seriously annoyed if you put him off with any foolish shilly-shallying.
Mind that. And here he is&mdash;at least, it's <i>somebody</i> at the front
door. I've mislaid my glasses as usual. And if it is Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>,
I shall send him in here at once; so remember what I've said. (<i>She
goes out into the hall, and discovers her nephew</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span>.) So it is
<i>you</i>, <span class="sc">Charles</span>! You're rather earlier than I expected.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Nothing much doing at the office, Aunt. And I thought
I might have to dress for dinner, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> You ought to know by this time that we are plain
people and do not not follow the senseless fashion of dressing ourselves
up for a family dinner, but I am glad you came early, all the
same, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, as I should like a little talk with you before your
Uncle comes in. We had better go into the study. (<i>To herself, as
she leads the way.</i>) Now I shall get it out of him!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">End of Scene XV.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene XVI.</span>&mdash;<i>In the Study.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey</i> (<i>fixing</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span> <i>with her eye</i>). What is
this I hear of
your proceedings last Saturday night, <span class="sc">Charles</span>? Come, you can't
deceive <i>me</i>, you know!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I never made any secret about my proceedings. I told
Uncle we might probably drop into the Eldorado or somewhere after
dinner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, in consternation</i>). The Eldorado? they
<i>did</i>
go there then! If only they didn't see me! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Yes,
<span class="sc">Charles</span>,
go on. And while you were there, did you see anyone you&mdash;you
thought you recognised?</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She's heard! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I should rather
think I <i>did</i>, Aunt. Never was more surprised in my life.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>with a groan</i>). And&mdash;and was your <i>Uncle</i>
surprised, too, <span class="sc">Charles</span>?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Uncle? I haven't told <i>him</i> yet.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> But he was <i>there</i>, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, with you; he must
have seen&mdash;whatever you did! Or didn't he?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> At the Valhalla? my <i>dear</i> Aunt!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Who's talking about a Valhalla? I mean the
<i>Eldorado</i>, of course; that was where you <i>said</i> you went!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> No&mdash;no, we couldn't get in at the El.;
all the stalls gone, so we went to the Val. instead.
Just the same sort of thing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, relieved</i>). To the Val.!
What a fright I've had for nothing! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
I quite understand, <span class="sc">Charles</span>. You took your
Uncle to a place called the Val., <i>not</i> the&mdash;er&mdash;El.
What did you <i>see</i> there? that's the point!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I didn't take Uncle there; I was with
a man from our office when I saw him. I must
have seen him there often enough, but somehow
I never spotted him before. It was the make-up,
the <i>disguise</i>, you know, wig and moustache, and
all that.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Do you mean to say your Uncle
attends music-halls disguised in a wig and moustache?
<span class="sc">Charles</span>, who was he <i>with</i>? I <i>will</i> know!</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>in fits of laughter</i>). Uncle? At the Val.
in disguise? now, is it <i>likely</i>? I thought you knew
all about it, or I shouldn't have said a word!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> You have said too much to stop
<i>now</i>, <span class="sc">Charles</span>. It is useless to try to turn it off
like that. If it was not Pa you recognised at this
Val. place, who <i>was</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If I don't tell her she'll
only go on suspecting poor old Uncle <span class="sc">Theo</span>.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, you're bound to find it out
sooner or later; and I admire him all the more
for it myself. I'd no idea he had it <i>in</i> him.
Shows how mistaken you may be in fellows.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> I've yet to learn who and what you
are talking about, <span class="sc">Charles</span>!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Why, that quiet, modest friend of
yours, Mr. <span class="sc">Clarence Curphew</span>, if you <i>must</i>
know!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> I don't believe it. Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> is
not at all the sort of young man to spend his
money in such resorts.</p>

<p class="center">"Dear, dear me!"</p></div>

<p><i>Charles.</i> He don't <i>spend</i> it there&mdash;he <i>makes</i> it.
My dear Aunt, you ought to feel honoured by
having such a distinguished acquaintance. Don't
you remember my mentioning the great music-hall star, <span class="sc">Walter
Wildfire</span>? You must. Well, <span class="sc">Clarence Curphew</span> and <span class="sc">Walter
Wildfire</span> are one and the same person&mdash;honour bright, they are!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>sinking back with a gasp</i>). A&mdash;a music-hall star!
And I have been urging <span class="sc">Althea</span> to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, how fortunate it is I
have been warned in time! He shall not see her&mdash;I will write and
put him off&mdash;at once!</p>

<p class="ind2">[Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>enters blandly</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Ah, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, my boy, so here you are? that's right,
that's right. You, too, <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>? (<i>To her, in an undertone.</i>)
It's all right, my love&mdash;our dear young friend, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, you know&mdash;we
met on the doorstep just now, and I've left him and <span class="sc">Thea</span>
together in the drawing-room. I thought it was best, eh?</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He looks to her for approval.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> You've left&mdash;&mdash; But there, I might have known!
No, don't speak to me, Pa&mdash;there's no time to lose! Come with
me, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, I may want you.</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>She rustles out of the room, followed by</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>looking after her in mild perplexity</i>). Dear, dear me!
I wonder what can be the matter <i>now</i>. <span class="sc">Cornelia</span> seems so very&mdash;&mdash; I
hardly like to go and see&mdash;and yet, perhaps, I ought&mdash;perhaps I
ought. There's one comfort, whatever it is, it can't have anything
to do with that dreadful Eldorado. Yes, I'd better go and look
into it!</p>

<h2>MAGIC AND MANUFACTURES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Fairy Fragment from the German.</i>)</h4>

<p>Little <span class="sc">Alice</span> was delighted with her surroundings. She had
found her way into a lumber-room, which was filled with modern
furniture and modern toys. "How pretty they are!" she exclaimed;
"and how I would like to speak to them!"</p>

<p>Then the Cup and Saucer labelled a "Present from Ramsgate,"
and the Old Grandfather's Clock glowed with satisfaction. Evidently
they wished to join in the conversation.</p>

<p>Then <span class="sc">Alice</span> thought that perhaps she might raise a sprite or a
goblin of some magical person by reading <span class="sc">Andersen's</span> Fairy Stories
backward. She had scarcely, with some difficulty, completed the
first page (rendered reversely) of "The Shepherdess and the Brave
Tin Soldier," when an old lady, about eighteen inches high, suddenly
appeared before her.</p>

<p>"You want all these inanimate things to speak?" said the new
comer. "Well, you will be disappointed if they do."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Alice</span> protested that she would be delighted beyond measure if
they would but talk. "It will be interesting, so very interesting,
dear godmother," she cried; and then she added, "I suppose I may
assume that you <i>are</i> my godmother?"</p>

<p>"You may assume anything you like," snapped out the little old
lady; "only don't bother me. Here! I authorise all these things to
talk. I will be back again by-and-by to see how you are getting
on. Adieu." And then the little old lady disappeared. And then,
as she had foretold, <span class="sc">Alice</span> suffered great disappointment.</p>

<p>The Cup and Saucer "A Present from Ramsgate," began
speaking sixteen words to the dozen, but <span class="sc">Alice</span> could not make
out the meaning. Then the Old Grandfather's Clock talked, but
without better effect. <span class="sc">Alice</span> could not understand a syllable.
And the box of tin Highlanders followed suit. So did a doll
dressed as an Irish peasant. Then all sorts of things that seemed
to be English to the backbone or last ounce of metal&mdash;scissors,
books, and calico curtains&mdash;kept up a fire of conversation. But
<span class="sc">Alice</span> could make out nothing. She was absolutely astounded.
Here were heaps of British goods suddenly endowed with the
power of speech, and yet she could not understand them!</p>

<p>And as she considered, the little old lady again appeared.</p>

<p>"Well, child!" she exclaimed. "What's the matter? You
seem perplexed! Have not all the toys been talking?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," faltered <span class="sc">Alice</span>; "but then you see I cannot understand
a word they say!"</p>

<p>"Of course you cannot," replied the Fairy. "They speak only
their native language."</p>

<p>"Their native language! Then why don't they speak English?"</p>

<p>"Because, my good girl," returned the Fairy, preparing to take
her departure, "they cannot. You see, young lady, they don't
know anything about the English language, and this is natural
enough, for they were all made in Germany!"</p>

<h2>THE FUTURE OF HOME RULE.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">Mr. Gl-dst-ne: Another Telepathic Automatic Interview.</span></h4>

<p>I had not seen Mr. <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span> for two days, nor had I heard from
him for three posts, neither knew I where he was. I knew he <i>had</i>
been at Downing Street. That evening I found myself in an Inner
Circle train, and no sooner there than I made up my mind to ask
Mr. <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span> if he would mind my interviewing him. My hand
at once wrote&mdash;on the margin of my evening paper&mdash;that he was at
Downing Street, and that I might have the interview. It was quite
an ordinary one, except that I thought the questions and wrote the
answers on my knee with my hand. "Well, Mr. <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span>," I
said, or, rather, thought, "what do you think of Home Rule?"
My hand (not the Old Parliamentary Hand) wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"W. E. G. I do not think that I shall be in any way departing
from what has long since become to be recognised as the practice
applicable to this present set of circumstances, a practice to which I
am able to speak from an experience of more than sixty years, when
I say speaking, not merely for myself, but for the whole of the
Members of the Cabinet, and, indeed, I may fairly say of the Government
in its entirety, that we are not indisposed to grant to Ireland
that measure of self-government for which she is asking in a
constitutional way through her duly elected representatives, and
that we earnestly hope that as a result of our efforts we may be
enabled, with a reasonable prospect of finality, to put an end to a
condition of affairs which for the whole of the present century has
embittered our relations with our sister country, and has exposed us
to the censures of every authority in the civilised world whose
acknowledged competency entitles him to an opinion."</p>

<p>Then I ventured a question as to the future. "What about Home
Rule next Session, Mr. <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne</span>?"</p>

<p>"The question as to what position the Home Rule controversy
will assume next Session is naturally one which can only be determined
when we have before us all the facts which are essential for
the purpose of enabling us to arrive at a definitive conclusion, and as
soon as it becomes reasonably plain what the exact position of parties
will be when it becomes necessary to decide on what lines the policy
of the Government will proceed. I may, however, say that, whilst
not forgetful in any way of the obligations of honour under which
the Liberal party lie to the Irish people, and whilst it will be our
duty at the earliest available moment to press forward measures
which shall carry out our pledges in that direction, we shall not
forget that the consideration of what are not unnaturally termed
English reforms is an imperative necessity, to which the attention
of the Government will be directed at the first opportunity."</p>

<p>By this time I had reached Charing Cross, and as I passed out the
ticket-examiner handed me a postcard. It was in Mr. <span class="sc">Gl-dst-ne's</span>
writing. Judge of my astonishment when I found that quite
spontaneously he had written to me just what I had written in the
interview. I at once wrote to him and informed him of what had
happened. His answer was: "It is most extraordinary. If I
didn't believe all you tell me, I should have come to the conclusion
that you faked (I think that is the word) the interview up out of
my old speeches." So there you have the whole story. Someone
suggests I should publish the postcard. Curiously enough, I have
mislaid it. But two and two make four, and you can go and ask the
ticket-examiner.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE OLD AND NEW SCHOOL&mdash;FOR SCANDAL.</h2>

<p>The two principal figures to be considered are Mr. <span class="sc">William
Farren</span>, who, as <i>Sir Peter</i>, is a Master of Arts in the <span class="sc">Old
School</span>,
and Miss <span class="sc">Rehan</span>, who as <i>Lady Teazle</i> is an experimentalising
teacher
in the New <i>School for Scandal</i>. All playgoers, whose memory takes
them back over a quarter of a century, must be familiar with
<span class="sc">William Farren's</span> <i>Sir Peter</i>, which, in our time may have
been rivalled, but has rarely been equalled (I do not remember
his equal in the past), and certainly never excelled.
A trifle overdone now and then, a trifle hard in manner
here and there, perhaps, but, as a whole, simply admirable.
Mr. <span class="sc">Daly</span> never made a better engagement than when
he secured <span class="sc">William Farren</span> for <i>Sir Peter</i>.
About Miss <span class="sc">Rehan's</span> <i>Lady Teazle</i> there will be various opinions
and,
truth to tell, I do not precisely know from what point of view and by
what standard to judge of her performance. <i>Sir Peter</i> describes her
as "a girl bred wholly in the country," and so forth, "yet," he
continues, "she now plays her part in all the extravagant fopperies
of fashion and the town with as ready a grace as if she had never
seen a bush or a grass plot out of Grosvenor Square." To let her
country training be perceived through the assumed airs and graces of
a town Madame seems to me to be Miss <span class="sc">Rehan's</span> object; and in this,
granting her ideas of the country hoyden and the town lady to be
correct, she certainly succeeds; notably in the scenes with <i>Sir Peter</i>.
For thus is the Jekyl-and-Hyde-ness of her character made apparent:
in company, in the scandal scenes, she is to be all airs and graces, but
when alone with her husband she, in spite of her perpetual wrangling
with him, reappears as her own natural self, with most of the polish
temporarily rubbed off. But if this be so, then, when in "society,"
her funny little run and shaking of the head are out of place, while
they may be accepted as a relapse into her provincialisms when she
is quite free and easy, <i>en tête-à-tête</i> with <i>Sir Peter</i>, and
especially
bent on captivating him by recalling to his memory the lass of whom
he had become desperately enamoured some eight months ago.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/249a-700.png"><img src="images/249a-300.png" width="300" height="359" alt="Shade of Sheridan." /></a>
<p style="width: 300px;"><i>Shade of Sheridan.</i> "William Farren, my old friend, I
congratulate you: and I suspect that in the present
generation I owe you much."</p>

<p style="width: 300px;"><i>Sir William Peter Farren Teazle.</i> "Not more than I
do you, Mr. Sheridan. Let us say, mutually indebted."</p>

<p class="indr" style="width: 300px;">[<i>They exchange snuff-pinches.</i></p></div>

<p>In the Screen Scene when "discovered," Miss <span class="sc">Rehan's</span> attitude
is eloquent; and on this tableau I have always thought the curtain
should descend, as all after this, even <i>Sir Peter's</i> exit with "damn
your sentiments," good as it is, is an anti-climax. I should prefer
that Miss <span class="sc">Rehan's</span> <i>Lady Teazle</i> should be silent, or if it must be
played as written, then here of all situations in the comedy would
I insist upon her emphasising the perfectly natural manner of the
unaffected country girl, instead of addressing Sir <i>Peter</i> in the deep
tones of a tragedian, as if attempting a mere theatrical effect. In
the last Act, as arranged, she appears to have done with her town
airs and graces for ever, and, wearing a queer sort of mob-cap, enters
on <i>Sir Peter's</i> arm, ready with him to face the ridicule, the satire,
and the scandal of their world.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Vanbrugh</span> makes a delightful <i>Lady Sneerwell</i>, and Mrs.
<span class="sc">Gilbert</span> a dear old <i>Mrs. Candour</i>, who would spitefully gossip
about
her neighbours for hours together. <i>Maria</i> is almost always a
thankless part, and Miss <span class="sc">Percy Haswell</span> leaves no doubt on the
mind of the audience of her being a poor orphan of some six months'
standing. The part of <i>Moses</i> offers very little scope to Mr. <span class="sc">James
Lewis</span>, especially as the celebrated "I'll take my oath of that"
is cut out, and some lines are introduced, which being quite un-Sheridanesque
and un-Mosaic do not in the least assist the character.
However, as he is much slapped on the back, dug in the ribs, and
generally treated as a butt by <i>Charles</i> and <i>Careless</i> (who, by the
way,
gives <i>"Here's to the Maiden"</i> in first-rate style), Mr. <span class="sc">Lewis</span> may
be
congratulated on getting to the end of his impersonation of one of the
long-suffering tribe in perfect safety. Mr. <span class="sc">Bourchier's</span> <i>Charles</i>
goes
well with the audience; but Mr. <span class="sc">George Clarke</span> is too conscientious,
and too impressed with a sense of the horrible scoundrelism of <i>Joseph's</i>
character to be ever really at home in so uncongenial a part.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/249b-600.png"><img src="images/249b-300.png" width="300" height="355" alt="Lady Ada Rehan Teazle." /></a>
<p class="center">Lady Ada Rehan Teazle.</p>
<p class="center">"In for some sort of a run"&mdash;at Daly's.</p></div>

<p>For the re-arrangement, much may be said "for," and more
"against." There is only one point that strikes me as absolutely
inartistic, and that is, making <i>Sir Peter</i> give his explanatory speech
about his wife <i>after</i> we have seen her, instead of leaving it in its
proper place, as <span class="sc">Sheridan</span> wrote it, where it serves as a prologue
to the subsequent scene between <i>Sir Peter</i> and <i>Lady Teazle</i>, when
she appears for the first time in the comedy.</p>

<p>There are some curious oversights in the scenic arrangements
at Daly's. The first is in <i>Charles Surface's</i>
picture gallery, <i>which has no windows and no
skylight</i>. The second is that though <i>Charles</i>
has sold all his books, yet through the door
of the picture-room are seen the first shelves of an evidently
well-stocked library. The third oversight is in <i>Joseph's</i> chambers,
described in the original play as "<i>a library in Joseph Surface's
house</i>," where, when he tells <i>Sir Peter</i> that "<i>books are the only
things I am a coxcomb in</i>," there are only a very few volumes to
be seen, and these are lying at haphazard on a table.</p>

<p>To revert for a moment to <i>Charles Surface's</i> windowless and skylightless
picture gallery, the scene takes place in the evening, after
dinner, or supper, and how is the huge apartment lighted? Why,
by a couple of ordinary candles placed on a side-table, while on the
mantelpiece at the back remain a couple of silver candelabra, filled
with candles which remain all the time unlighted. Why, naturally,
the company would have been in darkness, but not a bit of it, for
these two candles do give so preternaturally wonderful an illumination,
that the stage is as bright as a sunlighted garden at noonday
in July. The company that could produce such candles would make
a fortune by their patent. The dance at the end of the first Act
brings down the curtain to enthusiastic applause, and, to the end,
the old comedy, in spite of various chops and changes, holds its
own, as it ever will do, triumphantly.</p>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M. P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, November 13.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> has for
some time observed with deepening disfavour his position in House
as affected by, and compared with, that of his friend and companion
dear, <span class="sc">Tomasso Bowles</span>. <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, to drop into the affectionate
diminutive, is a mere child compared with him. He is but the
birth of the last General Election; whilst for thirteen years this
very month <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> has presented at Westminster Preston's
idea of the highest form of culture and intelligence.</p>

<p>Employers' Liability Bill offered opportunity for coming to front;
not that either as Employer or Employed <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> has any special
knowledge on subject. But he sees as clearly into its bearings as he
does through the average Lancashire stone wall. Awake at nights
drafting new Clauses that should baffle <span class="sc">Asquith</span> and make the <span class="sc">Squire
of Malwood</span> sit up. Looked most imposing on paper. Thought at one
time of posting copy to every elector of Preston, so that he might
see what a power in Senate is the borough Member. Wouldn't cost
so much since, posted at House of Commons in official wrapper,
they might go free. Still there would be remarks made if <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>
drove into Palace Yard enthroned on top of waggon containing
15,959 addressed copies of Amendments to Employers' Liability Bill.
Gave up idea. Electors must buy the papers where, in
Parliamentary reports, they would read voluminous digests of his
speeches.</p>

<p>Began soon after House took up Bill this afternoon. First group
of Amendments covered folio page of print. Read admirably; if it
had not been usual for Member in charge of new Clause to explain
to House its object and effect in operation success would have
been assured. Here's where <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> came to grief; talked for
some time; House listened at first, honestly intent upon considering
project, whatever it might he. Effect of <span class="sc">Tomlinson's</span> speech not
elucidatory. The more he talked the more hopeless the muddle.
When he sat down anguished listeners not quite sure whether he
had (1) moved the Clause, (2) proposed to withdraw it, or (3) suggested
that a more convenient place for insertion would he found later on.
Fortunately new Clause in print among Amendments. That
<span class="sc">Asquith</span> should decline to have anything to do with it natural
enough. Saddest of all befel when from his own side of House
<span class="sc">Rollit</span> bluntly denounced Clause, <span class="sc">Carson</span> hoped it wouldn't be
pressed, and <span class="sc">Henry James</span>, from allied camp opposite, demolished
it with final shot.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a href="images/251-1500.png"><img src="images/251-600.png" width="600" height="435" alt="THE HOME SECRETARY'S SAFETY-VALVE." /></a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>

<p>This not encouraging, but there were other Amendments standing
in his name of which something must be said. <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> rose
when called on, but gratefully sat down when greeted with mirthful
cries for division. Only gleam of comfort in sorrowful night
was when <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, rushing in whence he had retreated,
called down on himself <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> stern commentary that his
remarks were "quite irrelevant."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Report Stage of Employers' Liability Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;To casual observer there is nothing in personal
appearance of <span class="sc">Ughtred Kay-Shuttleworth</span> suggestive of the
Tartar. Yet to-night Sir <span class="sc">Ellis Ashmead Bart(lett)</span>, going a
hunting on the Treasury Bench preserves, bagged Secretary to
Admiralty and found he had caught a Tartar. <span class="sc">Ashmead</span>, in
his self-asserted character of <span class="sc">Britannia's</span> Confidential Clerk,
tried to draw <span class="sc">Ughtred</span> on subject of Naval Scare. <span class="sc">Shuttleworth</span>,
with manner that combined severity of a magistrate with
benignity of a dean, managed to present <span class="sc">Ashmead</span> in aspect of
fussy person who, having had some official knowledge, in whatever
subordinate position, ought to have been able to restrain the
self-assertiveness that led him to put such a question. House,
which does not do credit to The <span class="sc">Bart(lett)'s</span> many sterling
qualities, roared with delight. Stung to quick, <span class="sc">Ashmead</span> up
again; shouted across table, "I ask the right hon. gentleman
whether he can give me any evidence of his being alive&mdash;&mdash;"
House, struck with evidence to that effect just given, broke in
with fresh roar of laughter. <span class="sc">Ashmead</span> stood glaring round at
merry circle. When noise subsided, continued: "&mdash;&mdash;any evidence
of his being alive to the importance of his duties?" More
laughter. <span class="sc">Ashmead</span> appealed to <span class="sc">Speaker</span> to reprimand
<span class="sc">Kay-Shuttleworth</span>.
Speaker justified Minister's action. One more
attempt; one more rebuff; and <span class="sc">Ashmead</span> subsided for the night,
not quite sure after all that silence isn't golden. At least it
used to bring in £1000 a year.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;A good deal with the Employers' Liability Bill.</p>

<p class="center">Tommy Bowles and the Pilot.</p></div>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Another quiet sitting with Employers' Liability
Bill. Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, respectfully removing his tarpaulin,
and shifting his quid, relieved dullness of afternoon by some capital
yarns. One drew a vivid picture of dangers that lurk behind the
casual pilot. On a dark night in midsummer Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, a-sailing
down the coast of Barbaree, came upon what looked like a
town. Turned out to be Algiers; hauled
down his main yard; ran out the topgallantsail
spanker, and bore down on the harbour.
Just as he was entering was boarded by pilot.</p>

<p>"Sheer off!" says <span class="sc">Tommy</span> through his
polyglot speaking-trumpet. "Don't want your help;
know every rock and shoal on the coast;
will take the ship in myself."</p>

<p>Pilot produced from lining at back
of his trousers Code of Regulations; this
set forth that pilot was compulsory.
Nothing to do but submit, unless he
would involve Great Britain in war. Pilot
came aboard; took charge; forged ahead;
just going to run ship on breakwater
when <span class="sc">Tommy's</span> keen eye perceived danger.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the
only Member of House of Commons who, since <span class="sc">Big Ben's</span> death,
holds a sea captain's certificate, "I took my ship out of the pilot's
hand, and brought her in safely."</p>

<p>House uproariously cheered, and <span class="sc">Frank Lockwood</span> went off and
drew a sketch of the historical scene.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;More of Employers' Liability Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Government in difficulties to-night. <i>Cherchez la
femme.</i> <span class="sc">Walter M'Laren</span> had her in charge; a modest little
thing, merely asking that women, whether married or single, should
be enabled to vote at election of Parish Councils. House not very
full; no danger anticipated; but Conservatives joined their forces
with Radicals below gangway, and before Ministers quite knew
where they were they found themselves in minority of twenty-one.</p>

<p>"Winged!" cried Admiral <span class="sc">Borthwick</span>. "The <span class="sc">Fowler</span> went
out shooting, and comes home shot."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/252b-1000.png"><img src="images/252b-500.png" width="500" height="446" alt="'Winged!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Winged!"</p></div>

<p>Suggestion made that Government should resign; Mr. G. only
smiled.</p>

<p>Spiteful little thing <span class="sc">Rentoul</span> said just now. Supporting amendment
to Employers' Liability Bill he remarked "Gentlemen who
sit on this side of the House are in favour of the amendment;
gentlemen who sit on the other side of the House equally approve it;
whilst Sir <span class="sc">Albert Rollit</span>, who sits on every side of the House, does
not object to it."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Employers' Liability Bill reported; Government
defeated; got into Committee on Parish Councils Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Rather painful scene to-night between <span class="sc">Sydney Buxton</span>
and <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span>. <span class="sc">Sage</span>, ever thirsting for
knowledge, wanted to know much about Matabeleland. Drafted a

<p>"Unfounded assumptions," <span class="sc">Buxton</span>, in the pride of office,

<span class="sc">Buxton</span> referred Members to the question.</p>

<p>"But why," asked the <span class="sc">Sage</span>, with tremble and pathos in his
voice, "did you call them unfounded assumptions?"</p>

<p>Affected by this spectacle of genuine emotion, <span class="sc">Buxton</span> proposed to
substitute for the obnoxious word milder form "unproved."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the <span class="sc">Sage</span>, sticking to his point; "but you said
unfounded." No use <span class="sc">Buxton</span> attempting to deny this; lapsed into

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
